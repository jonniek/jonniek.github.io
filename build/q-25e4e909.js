December was very similar to November with the exception of the winter holiday. I started my holiday on the 23rd of December and ended it on the 8th of January.</p>

<h3>Trip to Seoul</h3>
<p>On my winter holiday I went to Seoul. I really wanted to see what kind of place it was since I was about to exchange there. I thought it would be very similar to Tokyo but it had a very unique atmosphere that is hard to describe. It was also very tourist friendly and you could get by with only English. Seoul at the time was really cold compared to Tokyo at around -5 degrees Celsius during daytime. I had a hard time staying outside for long periods since I didn't have proper winter clothes.</p>
<p>My favorite part about the visit in Seoul was by far the Korean sauna. As a Finn who likes saunas I had big suspicions about a "hot room" kind of sauna especially after a few disappointing ones in Japan. They had a few different kind of rooms — ice, salt and stone. The stone one was the warmest and my favorite. It was really relaxing and hot, way better than I expected. The sauna facility was really amazing. It was open 24/7, it had a spa, a pc room, a restaurant, saunas and a sleeping area. If I understood correctly it was a popular place to crash for a few nights similar to how capsule hotels are in Japan.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">Stone sauna</div>

<p>The sauna was in a popular night life district called Itaewon. It had an amazing atmosphere nothing like I've ever seen before. Many of the buildings there were very unique with interesting architecture. It was very fun to just walk around enjoying the brisk air after the sauna looking for a restaurant. Later while looking for a bar  I stumbled across a cool fairytale like stone path to some bar. It turned out to be the most amazing bar I have ever visited and it had no entrance fee! It was decorated in a similar sense to the path leading there. It looked like a castle ballroom with some modern night club touches. On the second floor they had all sorts of bar games and it was easy to strike conversations with people. I was very impressed by Itaewon to say the least.</p>

<p>The food in South Korea is also very delicious. I used to hate spicy food but after this visit I have learned to like it. The thing I like the most is how they serve kimchi with almost every meal. I really love kimchi! They have all kinds of wonderful hot soups that are a joy to eat when it's freezing cold outside.</p>

<h3>Trip to Kyoto & Osaka</h3>
<p>After Seoul I flew to Osaka and spent a few days in there and Kyoto. I really like Osaka. It feels a lot like Tokyo but has a similar rough vibe like Seoul.</p>
<img src="/images/namba.jpg" alt="Namba in osaka">

<p>I kind of dislike Kyoto since there is just so many tourists. If you decide to visit there I highly suggest going during off-season if you can.</p>

<p>One place I really recommend in this area is the Nara park. It's a huge park with a lot of forest trail with cool statues and shrines. There is also a lot of wild deer you can feed!</p>

<h3>New years in Tokyo</h3>
<p>I spent the new years eve in Shibuya but it was a very underwhelming experience. There was an absolutely insane amount of people, multiple times that of the Halloween. But since there was no fireworks or any kind of show it felt kind of lame. I guess new years eve is not so big in Japan. However, new years day is cool since temples have small stands that serve all kinds of tasty foods.</p>`}],_id:"1UXokUrGwEUQBBQk"},{title:"The cheapest yen for your euro",slug:"the-cheapest-yen-for-your-euro",created:{$$date:1507708942878},subtitle:"Comparing different ways to pay in Japan",category:"aw5oCNuLxgKXORyS",published:!0,sections:[{width:"normal",content:`<p>
When it comes to traveling and getting the local currency I am usually too lazy to research my options and just end up using ATMs. With many banks especially in Europe that is not a problem since there is usually no fees involved. However outside of Europe you will find that most(if not all) banks will charge a nontrivial amount for cash withdrawals on top of a exchange rate for the currency. Now that my stay is a lot longer than usual I wanted to dig into the details of just how to maximize the value of my euros.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not an expert in currencies or finance and might make some mistakes in my assumptions, research, math and observations so consider this as some guidelines rather than the absolute truth. Most things I will talk about are subject to change over time or situation so don't take them at face value but as possible options to research yourself.</p>
<h3>How to pay in Japan</h3>
<p>Japan's currency is the Japanese yen and you generally cannot pay for anything outside of airports with any other currency. Cash is king but some places will accept credit/debit cards. Cash will be necessary no matter what, which means you will either need to exchange cash or use an ATM to get yen.</p>

<h3>The value of the euro compared to yen</h3>
<p>The value of currencies and in this case the exchange rate between the yen and the euro is the main factor to how much money you get when you exchange your currency. The rate is speculative and everything from national to international events/regulation/situations/trade and more will affect the value of a currency. One way to take advantage of this volatility is to make purchases, withdrawals or exchanges on days with a favorable exchange rate but realistically that is not always possible.</p>
<p>As you can see from the chart below I am quite lucky that the euro has risen ~15% in value compared to the yen in just five months before the start of my exchange. The last time I visited in 2015 the exchange rate was also favorable hovering around 130JPY per 1EUR.</p>`},{width:"wide",content:`<img src="/images/eur-jpy.png" alt="yen to euro currency chart">

<hr>
<h3>Comparing our options</h3>
<p>All examples will use a market exchange rate of 135JPY for 1EUR and all fees will be calculated towards the market rate, not the given exchange rate by the bank/card.</p>

<p>
<h4>Exchange money in a bank</h4>
This is the old school way of doing things. You bring a big pile of cash to the bank and buy the target currency at a hopefully good exchange rate. The exchange rate will differ from bank to bank. In Finland I observed rates up to 6% different from the market while in Japan most banks hovered around 3%. If you do not find a good deal in Finland I suggest exchanging your cash at a Japanese bank in the airport(check the rate before you do!).</p>

<p>Price of 10.000¥ in Japan = <b>76,36€</b></p>
<p>Price of 10.000¥ in Finland with Forex = <b>78,80€</b></p>


<span>pros</span>
<ul>
<li>You can return any left over cash with a receipt free of charge with some banks</li>
<li>You can exchange at speculative peak exchange rates</li>
</ul>
<span>cons</span>
<ul>
<li>Risk of carrying a lot of cash</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Withdrawing yen from an ATM with euros</h4>
Using an ATM outside of Europe with most European banks will end up with rather big charges depending on the bank. Some banks will also have extra charges after certain amount of ATM withdrawals. My bank charges 2€ + 3% + the additional visa international exchange fee of ~2.15%. So you end up with a whopping 2€ + 5.15% fee. So if your only option left for cash is an ATM you should withdraw as large sums as possible without having leftover yen when you leave. Keep in mind that with ATM you can time your withdrawal on a day the exchange rate happens to be good, which could save you around 1.5% on some volatile days.</p>
<p>Price of 10.000¥ with Visa electron and Nordea on a 7/11 ATM = <b>78,09€</b></p>

<span>pros</span>
<ul>
<li>Convienient</li>
<li>No need to carry a lot of cash</li>
</ul>
<span>cons</span>
<ul>
<li>Quite expensive</li>
<li>Possible limits with cards/withdrawals</li>
<li>Possible extra fee for some ATMs</li>
<li>Your debit/credit card could break/dissapear rendering you with no way to get cash or pay</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Paying with a credit/debit card</h4>
Paying with a credit/debit card will use a very good exchange rate that in my experience only differs about 0.2% from the market rate. However my visa electron card takes a 1.95% exchange fee ending up with an around 2.15% total fee.</p>

<p>Price of 10.000¥ card purchase = <b>75,70€</b></p>
<span>pros</span>
<ul>
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>More secure than cash</li>
</ul>
<span>cons</span>
<ul>
<li>Availability is bad in Japan</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>You can draw your own conclusions from my observations above but I will give you my opinion.</p>
<p><h4>Short term stays</h4>
In my opinion the best method to pay in Japan for short stays is to exchange 80% of your budget into cash at a Japanese bank upon arrival. Then use your credit/debit card whenever possible especially for large purchases such as accommodation, shopping and fine dining. Finally if you need some extra cash use an ATM.</p>

<p><h4>For exchange students</h4>
As you might know exchange students can get scholarships and in Japans case it is the Jasso scholarship issued by the Japanese government which is around 600€/month worth of yen. I think you will not know beforehand if you can get it or not which is unfortunate. It is good to stay positive and hope for the best so you should keep the scholarship in mind when you consider ways to get yen. I would recommend you to take around 1000€ with you and exchange them at the airport in Japan. If you get the scholarship you will need to open a bank account and then you can live pretty much with the scholarship. If you do not get the scholarship you will regret only bringing 1000€ and panic about how to get more money. Your options at this point are opening a Japanese bank account, wire euros and exchange them or just use an ATM. You will only save 2% with the former method so I would suggest just deal with it and use ATMs with large withdrawals. If you get the information that you will not get the scholarship before you leave for your exchange then I would recommend bringing more euros and exchange them either at the airport or periodically at favorable exchange rates.</p>

In this article I will explore things that you should know about when arriving to Tokyo for your exchange and how you can prepare for some things.</p> 
<p>I'm having a hard time balancing writing about my experiences, sparking interest in people interested in exchange studies, keeping it informative for future exchange students and also informative in general for Tokyo or Japan so please bear with me while I find a comfortable format for the first few posts.</p><h3>Airport - money, mobile data, trains and accommodation</h3><p>I hope you will arrive to Narita airport, since if you don't I have almost no advice regarding your airport. When you arrive you will need some yen. Go ahead and exchange some of your currency at any banks exchange booth. If you didn't bring any cash or yen then I hope you know what you are doing. My next article will talk about cash in more detail.</p>
<p>The first time I traveled Japan in 2015 for three weeks I didn't buy a prepaid data plan. I had done a ton of research beforehand where to visit and what routes to take so the remaining small details was easy enough to figure out with accomodation or station wifi. However this time around since I was coordinating with my friend upon my arrival I wanted to be online to be able to connect with him any time and from anywhere. In Narita airport you can buy 7-30 day prepaid sim cards and pocket wifis. In my opinion they seem really expensive and that's why I took only a 7 day 2GB sim card for 3000 yen. After it expired I have not bought a new one. I will still keep an eye out for some deals and ask locals for some advice and I will maybe update here if I find some reasonable plans.</p>
<p>Narita airport is quite far away from Tokyo central and especially Hachioji where Tokyo national college of technology is located. I would recommend two options to go to Tokyo, one expensive and fast the other one cheap and slow. A third unrecommended option and the one I took unfortunately is the JR Narita express, which is both expensive(3000+JPY) AND slow(80 min. to Shinjuku). Skyline is around 2400 yen and will take you around 40 minutes to Nippori station. The cheaper route is a local train by the same company that will cost you around 1000 yen to Nippori but take around 80 minutes. Your choice of train should depend on your schedule and where you will stay the next night. You should first find a ticket machine and purchase an IC card with a few thousand yen charged. IC cards will let you travel carefree without buying tickets just by beeping them by the train gates and having them automatically charge you for your commutes. However some trains, usually longer distance ones, might not allow usage of IC cards. The two faster trains mentioned above are such trains and will need seated tickets to be purchased before entering the train. In some places you can pay with IC cards such as most vending machines at train stations.</p>
<p>If you want to stay at the campus dorm the first night I suggest arriving early in the morning on a regular weekday. In other cases you might need other accommodation for a day or two. For arrivals later than 18:00 I would suggest staying the first night in a hotel in Narita.</p>`},{width:"normal",content:`<h3>The school dormitory</h3><p>If you have read some student experiences from Tokyo you might have encountered some horror stories about the dormitory rules, and when you receive the rules many of them will have you question your exchange decision. But fear not, I'm here to tell you that the boys dorm is actually contrary to any of my expectations a very nice place.</p>
<p>The boys dorm is located close to the school gates and is 4 floors high. All the rooms I have seen are private rooms for one person but I heard there are shared rooms as well. Every floor has a bathroom area with washing machines and dryers. The shower rooms are on the other side of the building. The dorm has a pretty fast internet connection but many ports seem to be blocked which makes it inconvenient for many things such as ssh, gaming and other things that require ports to be open. If you want wifi you need to have a router.</p><p>Most of the people who live in the dorms are Japanese but some were from other Asian countries as well. There are three of us from Metropolia exchanging here and we are the only exchange students right now. We live close to each other in the dorms but research in different departments.</p><p>The only two important rules aside from common sense seem to be that there is no alcohol allowed in the dorm, you need to leave the dorm between morning and noon on school days and that you need to be present at 22:00 for the row call unless you let them know beforehand that you will be late. For overnight leaves you need to write the place you stay, a contact number and the duration. I would suggest anyone who is coming for exchange to take advantage of the school dormitory.</p><img src="/images/roomview.jpg" alt="View from the dorm window">
<div style="text-align:center">View from the dorm room window</div>`},{width:"normal",content:`<h3>The school, the campus and the surrounding area</h3><p>Tokyo national college of technology is a high school combined with a vocational school. That means that students are between 15 and 20 years old. I think there was some more details about how it worked that I didn't quite grasp but that is the gist of it. Our research projects will be done together with the older students. So far the relatively large age gap between us exchange students and other students has not been troublesome at all. On the contrary it feels like a benefit since it feels like we can befriend both students and the school staff.</p><p>The closest station to the school is Hazama station which can be reached by the Keio line from Shinjuku station. The Keio line is very convenient because it has many express trains that make it really fast to get around. From Hazama to Shinjuku it takes about 50 minutes. Hazama station is very small and only has a small mall and some stores a few streets away. The nearest station with things near it is Takao, which is a walking distance or one stop by train to the west from hazama. The closest city to the school is Hachioji which takes 20 minutes to reach by train. Hachioji has all kinds of things you would expect from a city and is a fun place to walk around. Our favorite activities there so far are darts & pool, izakayas(Japanese style bars) and karaoke.</p><img src="/images/hachioji_station2.jpg" alt="Hachioji station city view">
<div style="text-align:center">Hachioji central</div><p>The campus area is quite large by finnish standards, about 5 minutes of walking from end to end. There are two restaurants, the dorm restaurant and the school restaurant. The dorm restaurant is only for people who live in the dorms and has three meals a day. Exchange students sign the meals they eat and pay them by cash later. The school restaurant has rather cheap and good food during lunchtime and is mostly used by the school staff and students who do not live in the dorms. There is also a small convenience store which is useful if you miss the restaurant lunch times. There is a lot of different activities and sports you can participate in such as football, gym, baseball, basketball, table tennis, tennis, judo and more.</p><img src="/images/campus.jpg" alt="Campus view">
<div style="text-align:center">Small part of the campus area</div><h3>The first weeks</h3><p>When we arrived we were a little bit surprised by how little things were planned for us. For the first two weeks we usually only had one small thing to do per day and some other days nothing at all. We spent the remaining time settling in at our dorms, exploring the area, getting to know people at the campus and having fun. Some future events we were invited for include a welcome party, a campus culture festival, a homestay and a school trip.</p>`}],_id:"AQY4iDQRXY5xtHcJ"},{title:"November monthly recap",slug:"november-monthly-recap",created:{$$date:1511857640210},subtitle:"",category:"aw5oCNuLxgKXORyS",published:!0,sections:[{width:"normal",content:`<p>The past month flew by really fast. I'm sitting here trying to recall my memory but I can't think of that many things I did. I think most my days were spent researching, exercising, programming and going out to eat, drink and play darts.</p>

<p>The weather in November has been very excellent. There has been mostly sunny days which for me feels amazing since in Finland it is usually so dark and gloomy around this time of the year. The autumn in Tokyo is really beautiful with the bright days and colorful scenery. The warmest days you don't even need to wear a jacket during the daytime.</p>

<h3>Mount Takao</h3>
<p>Mountains are famous day trip locations during the autumn to see the colorful trees. One sunny Saturday we decided to visit mount Takao which is a small mountain just two stations away from our school. Our visit was a few weeks too early to catch the most colorful views but it was still quite nice!</p>

<p>The entrance to the mountain is a short walk through an old looking neighborhood filled with souvenirs and small stands. The hike up to the mountain is not very demanding but since we were sore from exercise from the previous day we took a chairlift up to about two thirds of the way. The remaining path to the top is filled with interesting sights from shops to temples.</p>

<h3>The local sushi restaurant</h3>
<p>When I look back at my exchange some of the fondest memories I had was relaxing with my friends in a local sushi restaurant. It is operated by Den, a 75-year old fun man. We visited his place regularly throughout our entire exchange and we became quite good friends. We even went out drinking with him one time. By now there has been two sets of exchange students after us and I hope they have visited Den. If you are planning on having an exchange there, please find this restaurant and say hello to Den from me. I wish to return and visit Den again in the future some day.</p>

<h3>Darts in Shamrock</h3>
<p>Me and my friends played a lot of darts in Shamrock. We kind of stumbled upon this bar during the beginning of our exchange but we quickly became regulars. Playing electronic darts was extremely entertaining and we quickly became quite good. At one point at the end of our exchange we even took on some of the other regulars who have been playing for years and won a match against them.</p>

<p>I'm quite sad that we don't have any Dartslive machines here in Finland. Live darts is fun as well but there was something special about Dartslive that I can't quite put my finger on. After returning from my exchange I have been playing live darts every now and then with my friends. I even created a <a href="https://github.com/jonniek/darts-open" target="_blank">point calculator</a> to make it easier to keep track of points.</p>

<p>I highly suggest you to try darts out!</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I was given the option to choose my research project from three different ones. Two involved reinforcement learning in the form of a game and a speech robot. The third was a more recent project concerning machine learning and big data. I chose the one with big data since it sounded the most challenging and interesting. My task currently is to reformat the data and research ways to apply it to learning tools and technologies. I will write a more detailed article about the project at the end of my exchange.</p>

<h3>Cold rainy days</h3>
<p>When I arrived in the end of September the first week or so the weather was very nice with sunny days with temperatures of around 25 degrees Celsius. I was enjoying myself and everything was great until suddenly it started raining. And it kept raining. And the rain did not stop for weeks. Actually there was some days here and there that the rain stopped but only two of them were sunny. I heard it was an exceptionally cold October because of these rains with some days peak temperatures hovering barely over 10 degrees.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rain the culture festival was a bit disappointing because there was heavy rain and the second day was canceled because of a typhoon. Despite the cold and rainy weather there was quite some visitors enjoying the event. I walked around the booths with my friend and tried different kind of snacks and foods but we didn't go see any performances. Since the day was so cold we decided to go to a Japanese hot spring bath. It was a nice place with many inside and outside pools. We heard the saunas would be like Finnish ones where you throw water on the rocks but to our disappointment it was just a warm room. Maybe one day we will find a Finnish sauna.</p>

It was nice and quiet around six but filled up a few hours later to an absurd point where it was almost impossible to move around.

The school in Seoul didn't seem to have many courses in English and most courses seemed to be for beginners which gave me doubts and I ended up changing the location to Tokyo. Changing was still possible even after the confirmation from Seoul had arrived. The reason I chose Tokyo instead was that a classmate of mine was also going there and the content of the exchange might be more appropriate for me. The application process was very straight forward so I will not go into detail about that.</p>
